# hello-world
Following the programmers tradition: Hello World :)

It's so exciting doing this... I feel like I already accomplished something towards my goal in leraning.
I've joined GitHub to learn, to be part of the growing community of creators and developers who make so many things possible.
Possibilities are paths. Some are clear, some need clearing, and some are already to be discovered.
Despite comming from a generation that saw the advent and popularization of the internet and connectivity, I watched it passively and didn't give any much thought.
But I feel now that I can be part of it. That I can also create and help to write the future. That my skills can be transfered and transformed to help others, and the exciting part of it is that there are tools like GitHub where I can land in a completely new territory and be welcomed and helped by giants.
Looking forward to all I will be living from now on.
